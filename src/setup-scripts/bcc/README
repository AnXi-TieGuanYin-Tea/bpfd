The files in this directory are for easier packaging of bcc and bpfd for anyone to try this project on Ubuntu.

Description of the setup scripts:

deb.control: DEBIAN/control file I use for the packaging.

bcc-init: Create the BCC sandbox, this is packaged and installed to /usr/bin/ by dpkg

bcc-env: This tool is packaged, but can also be used independently. Its purpose
is to make setting of BCC environment variables easier by providing command
line options for setting them, and printing what's already set.

bcc.bash.rc: This rc file is used by the sandbox (bcc-init) script to setup the
bash prompt, and introduces a 'bcc-set' alias that sources bcc-env to make the
setting of environment variables effetive in the current shell session.

TODO:
- Automated scripts to build packages, currently I build them manually.
