- get a parser infra written for tools to add remotes and debug options
- get it to use arm64 ptregs to access args correctly
- get it to use arm64 kernel build tree and custom tree paths

To get stackcount working:
    why doesn't it finish in bounded time?

Get syscount work:
    Already working, but make script read from /proc on target

Get filecount working:
    Make delitem work

old:
next:
- build bpf .o from kernel samples (simplest one)
- run loader on x86 and make it generate message (load prog)
- cross-compile protobuf + custom bpf loader (based on test read/write) for arm64
- copy messages + custom bpf loader to arm64 target, load and check if it works.
