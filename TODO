To get opensnoop working:
- add support for kprobe/kretprobe attach and verify they work - DONE
- add support for open_perf_buffer and callbacks
        - need to get map update/lookup working otherwise perf wont work
- add support kprobe_poll, note that opensnoop doesn't need map reads to work, just perf.

To get stackcount working:
- support lib.bpf_get_first_key and next_key

old:
next:
- build bpf .o from kernel samples (simplest one)
- run loader on x86 and make it generate message (load prog)
- cross-compile protobuf + custom bpf loader (based on test read/write) for arm64
- copy messages + custom bpf loader to arm64 target, load and check if it works.
